## Diverse coaches for coding workshops


*Note: This is an experimental project.*


#### My point of view:

I've coached at weekend coding workshops (Clojure Bridge London), but never organised one.

I've advertised/relayed the need for women coaches for DjangoGirls London or Clojure Bridge London (and Berlin). And sometimes it's effective!

I've wanted to travel to coach at coding workshops outside London, but haven't done it (yet).


#### Target audience:

Say you're organising (or planning to organise) a workshop aiming to introduce a public from underrepresented group(s) in tech to coding.

Here I'm thinking about workshops like Rails Bridge/Girls, Django Girls, Clojure Bridge, Go Bridge, etc... But it can apply to other events.


**You probably want your team of coaches to reflect the diversity represented in your group of students.**


#### Potential issue:

The reason those workshops exist in the first place is to help increase the diversity in the tech industry by showing minorities that coding is definitely a skill within their reach.

**This implies a limited pool of potential coaches from underrepresented groups.**


#### Potential solution:

It could be interesting to have **one place for workshop organisers to reach out to coaches**. And this public repository could be it.

1) Click on `Issues`, then `New issue`.

2) State the name, location and date of your workshop as the issue title.

3) In the issue description add:

   * a way to contact you (REQUIRED)
   * a few lines about the event: programming language/technology, event description, rough schedule (REQUIRED)
   * a link to the event's Code of Conduct (REQUIRED)
   * a link to the event webpage (OPTIONAL)
   * a specific minority group you'd like represented within your team (OPTIONAL)
   * a possibility to pay for coaches to come from a different city/country (OPTIONAL)


Hopefully other people can then relay this info into global or local mailing lists, Slack groups, IRC channels... or tweet it.


#### Other use for the repo:

Please, don't hesitate adding resources for workshop organisers.

Also don't hesitate to name potential sponsors willing to help fly/host coaches to/in workshop locations.

1) Click on `Fork` to fork the repository.

2) Clone the repository:

```
$~ git clone git@github.com:Eleonore9/diverse-coaches.git
```

3) And either add to the `README.md` or create a new markdown document (`.md` file).

4) After commiting and pushing your changes, submit a pull request by clicking on `New pull request`. =)
